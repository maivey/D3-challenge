          <p><span style = "font-size: 18px; font-weight:bold; color:darkslategray">Poverty</span> As illustrated above, there is a positive correlation between poverty and healthcare, smoking, and obesity. That is, the percentage
            of poverty increases with an increase in the percentage of lack of healthcare. There is also a positive correlation 
            between poverty and smoking. An increase in the percentage of poverty corresponds to an increase in the percentage of 
            people who smoke. Finally, there is a positive correlation between poverty and obesity. The states with a higher percentage of poverty
            tend to have a higher percentage of obesity in those states.
          </p>

          <p><span style = "font-size: 19px; font-weight:bold; color:darkslategray">Age </span> There is a negative correlation between age and lack of healthcare. 
            The states with a lower median age tend to have a higher percentage of people who lack healthcare.
            There is a weak positive linear correlation between age and percentage of smokers in the state.
            There is a very weak negative linear correlation between age and obesity. 
            Thus, more analysis must be done to determine if age and percentage of smokers and percentage of obesity exists.
             </p>

          <p><span style = "font-size: 19px; font-weight:bold; color:darkslategray">Income </span> There is a negative correlation between income and healthcare, smoking, and obesity.
            The states that have a higher median income tend to have a lower percentage of people who lack healthcare.
            The states that have a lower median income tend to have a higher percentage of people who smoke.
            Likewise, the states that have a lower median income tend to have a higher obesity percentage.
